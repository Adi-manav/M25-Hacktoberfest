# M25 HACKTOBERFEST CHALLENGE

Yay!üéâüéâ  It's another month of [Hacktoberfest](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com/).

Hacktoberfest is an open-source challenge hosted by Digital Ocean in collaboration with GitHub and other companies. This hackathon requires you to make at least 4 contribution to Open Source throughout the month of October. This is a great opportunity to contribute to Open Source and win some amazing prizes along the way.

A number of students in the Minerva University M25 community would be interested in participating in the hacktoberfest challenge. As a result, we have setup this repository to allow all interested M25 minervans to participate in one way or the other.

_This year, only the first **50,000 participants** get free merch! The time to make that contribution is now!_

### What can I contribute?
Hacktoberfest simply entails contributing to open source projects (like this one). A contribution can either be code or non-code. You don't necessarily have to contribute code to contribute to open source.
