## HOW TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS REPOSITORY.

We have setup two ways to contribute to this repository.

### Making non-code contributions
Navigate into the contributipns folder. You should see a file named 'Tips_and_tricks.md'.
Add a random tip or trick that may be useful for the M25 community and commit it.
It will be reviewed and count towards your hacktoberfest challenge.
You need to make a total of four pull requests to complete this challenge.

In the 'resources' folder, we have a file named 'python_questions.md' and a folder called 'answers.

To participate, you can:
#### Put in a fun question in the python_questions.md file that you'll love other M25 to answer.
* It should be a question that can be solved by writing python code.
* It may be a question based on an HC from class or a random algorithm question.
* Your question should have a unique number so that it is easy to identify the corresponding solution.
For example: Your question can be called 'question 1' or even question 1043' (just make sure it's a reasonable number)

### Making code contributions
#### Answer a question in the python_questions.md file.
You can also contribute by providing a python solution to any question in the python_questions file.
* Your solution should be written in python.
* You should make it well-commented so others can benefit from your code.
* You can answer a question that has already been answered if you provide a diferent solution. In other words, there can be multiple answers to a question.
* **Write your code in a python_file and upload it to the answers folder above**
* Your file name should be prefixed with the question number you are answering.
**For example if your code is an answer to 'question 1', then you answer file should be named '1_name.py'.**
* Last but not least, make sure your code actually works to solve the problem!
